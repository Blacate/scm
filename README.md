## SCM
ssh config manager

### Install

First, install the package:

```
npm install -g node-scm
```

Or use yarn to install: 

```
yarn global add node-scm
```

### Changed Files

+ `~/.ssh/config` : Will add `Include scm_config` to the end of file if not exist.
+ `~/.ssh/scm.json`: Managed by `node-scm`.
+ `~/.ssh/scm_config` : Generated by `~/.ssh/scm.json`, Included by `~/.ssh/config`.

### Usage

Print help info:

```
scm -h
```

List all ssh clients:

```
scm list
```

Get one of the ssh clients:

```
scm find <host>
```

Fiter matched ssh clients:

```
scm filter <keyword>
# This will give clients matching %keyword%
```

Add a ssh client:

```
scm add
```

Update one of the ssh clients:

```
scm update <host>
```

Delete one of the ssh clients:

```
scm delete <host>
```

### Notice

Since `Include scm_config` is at the end of `~/.ssh/config`, `Host` defined in `~/.ssh/scm_config` will be overwritten by the `Host` before `Include scm_config`
